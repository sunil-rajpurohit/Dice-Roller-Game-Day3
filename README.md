# 🎲 Dice Roller Simulator | Day 3 of #50DaysOfPython

Welcome to **Day 3** of my [#50DaysOfPython](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=50daysofpython) challenge!  
This project is a simple but fun **Dice Roller Simulator** built using Python.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🎲 Simulates a 6-sided dice roll
- 🔁 Allows user to roll repeatedly
- 🎉 Displays Unicode dice face (⚀ to ⚅)
- 💻 Lightweight CLI output with screen clearing for better experience

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- `random` – to simulate dice values
- `os` – to clear the screen for repeated rolls
- `time` – to create a rolling delay effect

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunilrajpurohit/day3-dice-roller.git
cd day3-dice-roller
```

### 2. Run the Script

```bash
python dice_roller.py
```

---

## 🎓 What I Learned

- How to use `random.randint()` to simulate dice roll logic.
- Displaying **Unicode characters** instead of plain numbers to make it visually appealing.
- Used `time.sleep()` to simulate rolling animation.
- Used `os.system('cls' or 'clear')` to clear the terminal for each new roll.

## ⏱ Project Time & Difficulty

- **Total Time Spent:** ~45 minutes  
- **Difficulty Level:** 🟢 Easy and fun!
